/* selsocsoc accessory library — starter assets
 * Data-driven 3D accessories for NPCs: in-hand, on-head, and back slots.
 * Each def is plain JSON (no code), so the editor can read, tweak and save them.
 * Slots: 'hand' (right), 'handL' (left), 'head', 'back'.
 *
 * Part kinds: sphere, box, cylinder, cone, torus, circle, shape (flat polygon).
 *   args: geometry constructor args (numbers only)
 *   pos: [x,y,z]   rot: [x,y,z] radians   scale: [x,y,z]
 *   color: hex number   roughness: 0..1
